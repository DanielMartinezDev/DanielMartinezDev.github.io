        <h2>Hi there, I am <span>Daniel Martinez</span>!</h2>
        <p>I am a Front-End Developer from Spain. I started my coding journey in 2022 in hopes of changing my career and learning a new powerful skill. <br>
        I started with HTML, CSS and Javascript and quickly fell in love with web development. <br>
      I have always been a creative person and this new skill has lead me to use my creativity in ways I could have never imagined. <br><br>
    In the beginning I got very frustrated when my code would not run, but I got even more frustrated when it was just because I had forgotten to wright a coma or a semicolon. <br>
  However, after a few times of endless research and sleepless nights thinking about what could possibly the problem, I started getting very fast at pointing out the mistakes and moving on with the project. <br>
<br>
All of this to say, coding has taught me aspects of life I was not expecting to learn when I started my journey as an Engineer. <br>
Aspects like perseverance, patience, and optimism; because the solution is out there and with today's technology anyhing is possible; and that does not apply simply to computers.
